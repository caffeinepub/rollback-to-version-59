# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Improve the month archive UX on the Overview tab and restore access to older months directly within the History tab.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Overview Archive UI to display the selected month/year inside a clear tile/card element, separate from the calendar trigger button, and keep it in sync with month changes.
- Relocate/redesign the Overview month archive selector to be more compact and intuitively placed (while keeping the reset action clearly tied to the archive controls) so the main Overview content doesn’t get pushed down.
- Add month/year selection controls to the History tab and apply them to History filtering so users can view older months directly from History, including a clear return-to-current-month action and initial selection from any Overview-provided session parameters.

**User-visible outcome:** On Overview, the selected archive month is shown prominently in a dedicated tile and the archive controls take up less space; on History, users can pick any month/year to view transactions (and return to the current month) without needing to navigate via Overview.
