However, due to truncation and limited evidence, it is not fully verifiable that all required amount displays (including Monthly/Day-wise HTML reports and FilterTransactions real transaction rows) were updated and that no sign-based logic remains.",

      "requirement": "Monthly Transactions HTML report uses outgoing=red/incoming=green consistently for the amount cell.",

      "reason": "FilterTransactions.tsx only shows an import of `getDerivedRowAmountColor` (for derived rows). There is no visible evidence that real transaction rows use `getAmountColorFromType`/direction-based coloring, and the file is truncated before the rendering section.",
