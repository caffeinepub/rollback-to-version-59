  "summary": "REQ-3 appears implemented in TransactionHistory via month/year state initialized from session parameters, calendar-popover selection handlers, and month-based filtering. Evidence for the specific Overview Archive UI redesign (REQ-1/REQ-2) is not present in the provided truncated Dashboard diff, so those requirements cannot be verified as implemented from the diff summary alone. An unrelated documentation-style file change introduces/claims features not requested (PIN auth, new transaction types, offline-first behavior).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update the Overview Archive UI so the selected month name is displayed inside a clear, tile-like element (within the Archive area) rather than being only part of a long button label.",
      "reason": "Dashboard UI/rendering changes that would show the month/year inside a distinct tile/card are not visible in the provided (truncated) diff excerpt, so implementation cannot be confirmed from the diff summary.",

        "frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx (truncated)"

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Relocate and redesign the month archive selection control to a more intuitive placement and layout so it does not dominate the Overview tab content while still being easily discoverable (including a clearly associated reset action).",
      "reason": "The diff excerpt shows state/handlers for archive month and reset, but the actual layout/placement in the Overview tab is not visible in the truncated content, so the UI relocation/redesign and associated reset placement cannot be verified.",

      "description": "Offline PIN-based authentication flow (additional authentication method beyond Internet Identity).",
      "reason": "Not requested (explicit non-goal: do not add new authentication methods), but the modified summaries file claims a new PIN auth hook/component and an offline PIN authentication flow.",

    {
      "description": "New transaction types (e.g., “Savings (10%) Out” and “Deductions Out”) and related balance calculation changes / offline-first localStorage data management.",
      "reason": "Not requested (non-goal: do not change transaction data structures or add new transaction types unless required for the UI fixes), but the modified summaries file asserts these features.",
