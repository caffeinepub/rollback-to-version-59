  "summary": "The diff shows updates to MonthlyTransactions with safer defaults (e.g., unknown transaction type label) and some filtering logic, but the MonthlyTransactions change is truncated, so key acceptance criteria around the actual runtime-error fix and search/filter hardening cannot be fully verified from the provided evidence.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Fix the runtime error that causes the app to render a blank screen when the user clicks the \"Monthly\" tab in the Dashboard.",
      "reason": "MonthlyTransactions.tsx is truncated before the full render/search/filter logic and any explicit error-boundary/guard changes; the diff summary does not provide enough evidence to confirm the specific runtime exception causing the blank screen is addressed and that switching to the Monthly tab produces no uncaught exceptions.",

        "frontend/src/components/MonthlyTransactions.tsx (truncated)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Harden the Monthly Transactions UI against common data-shape issues so it cannot crash during filtering/searching (e.g., missing/empty description values, unexpected transactionType values) and instead continues rendering with safe fallbacks.",
      "reason": "The diff shows a fallback label for unknown transaction types, but the search portion is explicitly truncated (\"// Apply sear...\") so there is no visible evidence that searching safely handles undefined/empty descriptions or that all filter modes are guarded against unexpected row shapes without crashing.",
